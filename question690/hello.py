# You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, his importance value and his direct subordinates' id.
#
# For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.
#
# Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
# Output: 11
# Explanation:
# Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
#
# Note:
#
#     One employee has at most one direct leader and may have several subordinates.
#     The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.
